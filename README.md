Super Mario Game (Side-Scrolling) Made on Phaser
A Super Mario-style side-scrolling game built using Phaser is a platformer where the player controls Mario (or a similar character) to navigate through levels, avoid obstacles, defeat enemies, and collect coins or power-ups. Below are the key details about how such a game can be implemented using Phaser:

1. Game Features

Core Gameplay:
Side-Scrolling: The camera follows the player as they move horizontally through the level.
Platforming: The player jumps between platforms, avoids pitfalls, and interacts with the environment.
Enemies: Various enemies like Goombas or Koopa Troopas that can be defeated by jumping on them or using power-ups.
Coins and Power-Ups: Collect coins for points and power-ups like mushrooms or fire flowers to enhance abilities.
Level Progression: Multiple levels with increasing difficulty, including boss fights.

Player Abilities:
Movement: Left, right, and jump controls.
Power-Ups: Gain abilities like shooting fireballs or growing larger.
Defeating Enemies: Jump on enemies or use power-ups to defeat them.

2. Implementation Details

Phaser Features Used:
Physics System: Phaser's Arcade Physics is used for collision detection and gravity.
Tilemaps: Levels are created using tilemaps for platforms, ground, and obstacles.
Spritesheets: Character animations (running, jumping, idle) are implemented using spritesheets.
Camera: The camera follows the player as they move through the level.
Groups: Enemies, coins, and power-ups are managed using Phaser groups.

3. Key Components

Player:
Sprite: The player is represented as a sprite with animations for running, jumping, and idle states.
Controls: Keyboard or touch controls for movement and jumping.
Physics: Gravity and collision detection for realistic movement.

Enemies:
Behavior: Enemies move back and forth or chase the player. They can be defeated by jumping on them or using power-ups.
Collision: Enemies interact with the player and platforms.

Platforms:
Static Platforms: Fixed platforms for the player to jump on.
Moving Platforms: Platforms that move horizontally or vertically to add challenge.

Coins and Power-Ups:
Coins: Collectible items that increase the score.
Power-Ups: Items like mushrooms (grow larger) or fire flowers (shoot fireballs).
